## Presentation

This project is a stack Swift that can be ran as a standalone backend. Or in a fullstack with another of our repo of your choice (ex: [Node](https://github.com/weareopensource/Node)). 

You can have more informations about : 

* our mindset and what we would like to create in our [introduction](https://weareopensource.me/introduction/) (in construction)
* how to create a fullstack from our repo in our [wiki](https://github.com/weareopensource/weareopensource.github.io/wiki) (in construciton).
* our global roadmap and propose ideas about stacks in our [board](https://github.com/weareopensource/weareopensource.github.io/projects/1)

Our stack Swift is actually in development.

## History

This work is based on [MEAN.js](http://meanjs.org) and more precisely on a fork of the developers named [Riess.js](https://github.com/lirantal/Riess.js). The work being stopped we wished to take it back, we want to create updated stack with same mindset "simple", "easy to use". The toolbox needed to start projects, but not only with Node and Angular ...

## [We Are Open Source, Who we are ?](https://weareopensource.me)
Today, we dreams to create Backs/Fronts, aligns on feats, in multiple languages, in order to allow anyone to compose fullstack on demand (React, Angular, VusJS, Node, Nest, Swift, Go).
Feel free to discuss, share other kind of bricks, and invite whoever you want with this mindset to come help us.
